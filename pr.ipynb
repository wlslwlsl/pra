Although the technique can be applied in a variety of domains, it's very common in Computer Vision, and this will be the focus of the tutorial. Adjustments are made to the original images in the training dataset before being used in training. Some example adjustments include translating, croping, scaling, rotating, changing brightness and contrast. We do this to reduce the dependence of the model on spurious characteristics; e.g. training data may only contain faces that fill 1/4 of the image, so the model trainied without data augmentation might unhelpfully learn that faces can only be of this size.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/doc/tutorials/data_aug/outputs/with_mask/orig_vs_aug.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 480px;\"/>\n\n## Masks\n\nCertain Computer Vision tasks (like [Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06204)) require the use of 'masks', and we have to take extra care when using these in conjunction with data augmentation techniques. Given an underlying base image (with 3 channels), a masking channel can be added to provide additional metadata to certain regions of the base image. Masking channels often contain binary values, and these can be used to label a single class, e.g. to label a dog in the foreground. Multi-class segmentation problems could use many binary masking channels (i.e. one binary channel per class), but it is more common to see RGB representations, where each class is a different color. We take an example from the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/).\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/doc/tutorials/data_aug/outputs/with_mask/masks.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n\n## Data Augmentation with Masks\n\nWhen we adjust the position of the base image as part of data augmentation, we also need to apply exactly the same operation to the associated masks. An example would be after applying a horizontal flip to the base image, we'd need to also flip the mask, to preserve the corresponsence between the base image and mask.\n\nColor changes to the base image don't need to be applied to the segmentation masks though; and may even lead to errors with the masks. An example with a RGB mask, would be accidentally converting a region of green for dog to blue for cat.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/doc/tutorials/data_aug/outputs/with_mask/aug_and_mask.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n\n# Custom Dataset\n\nWith Gluon it's easy to work with different types of data. You can write custom Datasets and plug them directly into a DataLoader which will handle batching. Segmentation tasks are structured in such a way that the data is the base image and the label is the mask, so we will create a custom Dataset for this. Our Dataset will return base images with their corresponsing masks.\n\nIt will be based on the `mx.gluon.data.vision.ImageFolderDataset` for simplicity, and will load files from a single folder, containing images of the form `xyz.jpg` and their corresponsing mask `xyz_mask.png`.\n\n`__getitem__` must be implemented, as this will be used by the DataLoader.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "%matplotlib inline\nimport collections\nimport mxnet as mx # used version '1.0.0' at time of writing\nfrom mxnet.gluon.data import dataset\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import imshow\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nmx.random.seed(42) # set seed for repeatability\n\n\nclass ImageWithMaskDataset(dataset.Dataset):\n    \"\"\"\n    A dataset for loading images (with masks) stored as `xyz.jpg` and `xyz_mask.png`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    root : str\n        Path to root directory.\n    transform : callable, default None\n        A function that takes data and label and transforms them:\n    ::\n        transform = lambda data, label: (data.astype(np.float32)/255, label)\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, root, transform=None):\n        self._root = os.path.expanduser(root)\n        self._transform = transform\n        self._exts = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png']\n        self._list_images(self._root)\n\n    def _list_images(self, root):\n        images = collections.defaultdict(dict)\n        for filename in sorted(os.listdir(root)):\n            name, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)\n            mask_flag = name.endswith(\"_mask\")\n            if ext.lower() not in self._exts:\n                continue\n            if not mask_flag:\n                images[name][\"base\"] = filename\n            else:\n                name = name[:-5] # to remove '_mask'\n                images[name][\"mask\"] = filename\n        self._image_list = list(images.values())\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        assert 'base' in self._image_list[idx], \"Couldn't find base image for: \" + image_list[idx][\"mask\"]\n        base_filepath = os.path.join(self._root, self._image_list[idx][\"base\"])\n        base = mx.image.imread(base_filepath)\n        assert 'mask' in self._image_list[idx], \"Couldn't find mask image for: \" + image_list[idx][\"base\"]\n        mask_filepath = os.path.join(self._root, self._image_list[idx][\"mask\"])\n        mask = mx.image.imread(mask_filepath)\n        if self._transform is not None:\n            return self._transform(base, mask)\n        else:\n            return base, mask\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self._image_list)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Using our Dataset \n\nUsually Datasets are used in conjunction with DataLoaders, but we'll sample a single base image and mask pair for testing purposes.
